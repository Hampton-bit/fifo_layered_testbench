# FIFO Verification – Digital Design Verification Assignment

This repository contains the layered SystemVerilog testbench for verifying a parameterized Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) design, created as part of the Digital Verification Training at **NUST Chip Design Centre (NCDC)**.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:

* Build a layered testbench using SystemVerilog.
* Apply advanced testbench architecture techniques.
* Fully verify the FIFO across various scenarios including corner cases.
* Use assertions and coverage to validate correctness.

| -- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

| 3  | FIFO Empty                      | Verifies empty flag is set on full readout.           | Passed                        |
| 4  | Read After Write                | Checks data integrity for single write and read.      | Passed                        |

| 10 | Depth Tracking                  | Ensures FIFO fills to exact DEPTH.                    | Passed                        |
| 11 | Pointer Overflow                | Verifies safe operation near pointer limits.          | Passed                        |
| 12 | Reset Pointer Overflow          | Tests reset during overflow.                          | Failed (full flag misbehaves) |
| 13 | Reading When Full               | Verifies correct transition from full.                | Passed                        |
| 14 | Depth Test                      | Validates flag behavior at DEPTH boundary.            | Passed                        |
| 15 | Random Operations               | Performs 160,000 random ops with golden model check.  | Passed                        |

## Assertion Checks

**full\_test**
Ensures full flag remains high when full and no read occurs.

**empty\_test**
Checks that empty flag stays high during reads with empty FIFO.

**depth\_test**
Verifies FIFO becomes full exactly after `DEPTH` writes.

---

## Coverage Model

* Write Enable & Read Enable Coverage
* Data Value Bins: Low / Mid / High
* Full & Empty Flag Transitions
* Cross Coverage: `write_en` vs `read_en` excluding simultaneous reads/writes

All coverage points were exercised across tests, achieving 100% coverage except for the failed reset corner case.

## How to Run

1. Compile using Xcelium:

   ```bash
   xrun -sv -f filelist.f -access +rwc
   ```

2. Run simulation:

   ```bash
   xrun -R
   ```

3. View coverage:

   ```bash
   xrun -covdump -covtest testname
   ```

## Notes

* Tested with 3 configurations:

  * `DEPTH=8`, `WIDTH=8`
  * `DEPTH=16`, `WIDTH=16`
  * `DEPTH=32`, `WIDTH=32`

* One known issue in **Reset FIFO Pointer Overflow Test**:

  * Full and empty flags misbehave under reset + writes.
  * Further debugging needed.
